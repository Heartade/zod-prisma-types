you are working on a generator for prisma orm
this generator is used to generate zod schemas for prisma models and input types.

- first the schemas to generate are derived from the type and optionality/nullability of the database field in the prisma schema
- the generated schemas can be modifid with rich comments defined by three slashes `///` in the prisma schema
- the generator is based upon extending the prisma dmmf (Datamodel Metaformat)
