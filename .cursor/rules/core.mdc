you are working on a generator for prisma orm
this generator is used to generate zod schemas for prisma models and input types.

- first the schemas to generate are derived from the type and optionality/nullability of the database field in the prisma schema
- the generated schemas can be modifid with rich comments defined by three slashes `///` in the prisma schema
- the generator is based upon extending the prisma dmmf (Datamodel Metaformat)
- the current version of zod that needs to be targeted by the generator is v4.x.x - docs can be found here: https://zod.dev/v4
  - - if you are not shure what the current version of zod currently can do, always ask if a feature is implemented - do not come up with your own ideas of what it can do
- the current version of Prisma is v6.x.x with v7 on the horizon
  - if you are not shure what the current version of prisma currently can do, always ask if a feature is implemented - do not come up with your own ideas of what it can do

## Workspace

the workspace is structured in a monorepo using turborepo

- the actual generator can be found in packages/generator
- the project for testing can be found in packages/usage which hosts a simple app with a prisma schema found in packages/usage/prisma/schema/\*\*.prisma
